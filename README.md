## Goals

The goal of this project is to further solidify my understanding of the most fundamental concepts of React 
like components, props, state, event handlers and Next.js client and server components. I will also use
this project to implement CI/CD using GitHub actions for the first time. After this project and my 
[Reactful numbers](https://github.com/NikolaBV/Reactful-numbers) project I will move on to creating
full stack web applications using these technologies.
